+ demo:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-yJ-2UkMR25wYqb74ijmQH0yn60-UnKD?usp=sharing

+ 你需要注意的幾點
  + 在你完成程式後要丟到github，請新增一個資料夾丟你的檔案，並新增readme.md寫入你做的功能，這部分是為了之後的整合作業
  + 不要覆蓋別人完成的程式碼
  + 所有引用到的資料來源、使用工具..務必到github中寫上
  + 請在群組中友善發言，可以盡量提出你的想法，跟你認為要新增的功能等等
    + 團隊合作、集思廣益...非常重要~ 
  + 考慮到大家都是社畜，所以平日可以多寫上你的想法跟紀錄大概要做的事情，假日再來將那些需要完成的部分搞定
  + 參考去年，他們會在10/5對你的作品提出一些建議，10/6結束前要把所有資料包含程式等等整理到nasa的比賽平台上傳
  + 10/6後不可動github任何程式，他們會看最後上傳時間，若違反會被取消資格
  + 比賽有多個獎項，區賽前三能晉級世界賽，為台灣爭光
    + 台北、台中、高雄 > 我們這次選高雄，因為台北競爭激烈XD
    + 沒晉級也有機會拿到其他獎項，今年好像有些改變~
  + 最後需要提交影片、PPT報告、程式碼，平台需要部屬上線，讓NASA的人可以瀏覽
  + 10/5、10/6務必務必要空出時間!!! 所有人都要上線出席
  + 功能盡可能的完整，這會是一個很重要的評分點
    + 所以現在要求至少完成NASA題目頁面有提到的功能!!
  + 

+ future work
  + 研究如何讓 streamlit 載入資料集速度變快
  + 增加人與氣候相關資料 -> 人數與氣候的影響
  + 修改UI介面
  + 新增圖表配置
  + 溫室效應或許可以跟戰爭、或是房價、油錢、稅等等有關
    + 思考呈現出來的故事跟人要有連結，要不然只有數字，估計只有專家會看
    + 需有更多資料餵給LLM當prompt，生成的故事才夠合理
  + ..
 
+ What you need to pay attention to
   + After you complete the program and want to throw it to github, please add a folder to throw your file, and add a new readme.md to write the functions you made. This part is for the subsequent integration work.
   + Don't overwrite code written by others
   + All cited data sources and tools must be written in github
   + Please speak in a friendly manner in the group. You can try your best to put forward your ideas, the features you think should be added, etc.
     + Teamwork and brainstorming...very important~
   + Considering that everyone works on weekdays, the time available for project research may be limited, you can write more about your thoughts and record the things you need to do on weekdays, and finish the parts that need to be completed during the holidays.
   + Refer to last year, they will make some suggestions on your work on 10/5. Before the end of 10/6, all data including programs, etc. must be organized and uploaded to NASA's competition platform.
   + Do not touch any GitHub program after 10/6. They will look at the last upload time. If you violate it, you will be disqualified.
   + The competition has multiple awards. The top three in the regional competition can advance to the world competition and win glory for Taiwan.
     + Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung > We chose Kaohsiung this time because competition in Taipei is fierce XD
     + Even if you don’t advance, you still have a chance to win other awards. There seems to be some changes this year~
   + Finally, you need to submit the video, PPT report, and program code. The platform needs to be online so that people from NASA can browse it.
   + Be sure to make time on 10/5 and 10/6!!! Everyone must be online to attend
   + The functions are as complete as possible, this will be a very important scoring point
     + So now it is required to complete at least the functions mentioned on the NASA question page!!

+ future work
   + Add information related to people and climate -> The impact of people and climate
   + Modify UI interface
   + Added chart configuration
   + The greenhouse effect may be related to war, housing prices, gas money, taxes, etc.
   + The story presented by thinking must be connected to people, otherwise it will only be numbers, and only experts will probably read it.
   + More information needs to be fed to LLM as a prompt so that the generated story is reasonable enough.
   + Study how to make streamlit load datasets faster, Because it may be affected by the loading speed of your own hard disk
  
 
## 競賽相關描述 Competition related description

Potential Considerations
You may (but are not required to) consider the following:

Your story can take many forms. For instance, you could:
Use an interactive developer platform, like Jupyter Notebook or similar applications, to produce graphics and images from GHG Center data.
Produce a dashboard where users can select a region, type of greenhouse gas, and related variables and see a summary of climate change in the selected area.
Produce user-friendly visualization tools. Specific examples include:
Design a user-friendly Python library around the GHG-Center TiTiler Application Programming Interface (API) to make it easier to draw plots with GHG-Center data.
Build your own data explorer out of GHG-Center data using the TiTiler API as well as the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) API.
Leverage the TiTiler and GIBS APIs to build a website/web-based story that describes different ways NASA measures and models GHGs and/or the carbon cycle.
Compare GHG data with socioeconomic data and use that comparison to tell a story.

Datasets
The US GHG Center currently contains 13 federal datasets. Most of the datasets contain GHG data, but one contains population density data. You might find the population density dataset useful, if it is used in conjunction with at least one other dataset containing GHG data.

GHG Center datasets are from several different federal agencies. You can use as many of these datasets as you like to inform your story, but if you want to be eligible for global judging, don’t forget to use at least one NASA dataset.
Definitions (adapted from NASA and IPCC)

Greenhouse gasses (GHGs): gasses in the atmosphere that trap heat from the Sun.

Fossil fuel: Any hydrocarbon (chemical containing only carbon and hydrogen) deposit that can be burned for heat or power, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas.

Carbon dioxide (CO₂): A naturally occurring gas, CO₂ is also a byproduct of burning fossil fuels (such as oil, gas, and coal), of burning biomass, of land-use changes (LUCs) and of industrial processes (e.g., cement production). It is the main gas contributing to climate change.

Methane (CH₄): A greenhouse gas that is the major component of natural gas and is associated with all hydrocarbon fuels. Significant human-caused methane emissions also occur as a result of some agriculture activities. Methane is also produced naturally where organic matter decays under anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions, such as in wetlands.

GHG source: Something that releases a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. For example, the burning of fossil fuels is a source of GHG emissions.

GHG sink: Something that removes a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. For example, plants—through photosynthesis—transform carbon dioxide in the air into organic matter, which either stays in the plants or is stored in the soils. Thus, plants are a sink for carbon dioxide.

Carbon budget:
Global carbon budget: the assessment of global carbon sources and sinks, and the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration.
Total carbon budget: the maximum amount of net global human-caused CO2 emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level.
Top-down estimates: source and sink estimates derived from atmospheric observations.
Bottom-up estimates: source and sink estimates derived from land and ocean models or activity data.
Lateral fluxes: the flow of carbon between different types of sources and sinks (e.g., lateral flow of agricultural products from growth to consumption, riverine transport of soil carbon from land to ocean systems).
